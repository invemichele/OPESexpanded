for complete DeltaFs.data and all_Colvar.data files.

Notice that these files were obtained with a development
version of the code, and the header of DeltaFs.data will
be different with the current PLUMED implementation.
Also, to obtain the same temperature steps one should add
the keyword NO_GEOM_SPACING to ECV_MULTITHERMAL_MULTIBARIC

Since the current version of ENERGY does not take
into account for the tail corrections (DispCorr EnerPres),
the energy from GROMACS was used for reweighting (full_ene)
