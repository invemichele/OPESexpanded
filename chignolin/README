for complete DeltaFs.data and all_Colvar.data files.

Notice that these files were obtained with a previous
version of the code, and the header of DeltaFs.data will
look different with the current one.

Also, since the current version of ENERGY does not take
into account for the tail corrections (DispCorr EnerPres),
the energy from GROMACS was used for reweighting (full_ene)
