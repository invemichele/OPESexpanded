A Unified Approach to Enhanced Sampling - [Phys. Rev. X 10, 041034 (2020)](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.10.041034)

This repository contains all the input files and scripts needed to reproduce the results of the paper, and all the data used to produce the figures.
The full trajectories are available in the Materials Cloud Archive, https://archive.materialscloud.org/record/2020.81

The software used is PLUMED v2.7, GROMACS 2018.4, and LAMMPS (7 Aug 2019)

The OPES code provided here is the development version.
The stable code has been included within the OPES module in PLUMED v2.8, see [here](https://www.plumed.org/doc-master/user-doc/html/_o_p_e_s__e_x_p_a_n_d_e_d.htmlhttps://www.plumed.org/doc-master/user-doc/html/_o_p_e_s__e_x_p_a_n_d_e_d.html).
It uses a slightly different syntax, as specified also in the provided plumed.dat files.
